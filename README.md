Got it! Let's incorporate instructions for installing dependencies directly into the main `README.md` file of your project:

# Asynchronous File Downloader

This Python script uses asyncio and aiohttp to asynchronously download multiple files from specified URLs. It supports custom filenames and displays notifications upon successful downloads using Plyer.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `asyncio` module (standard in Python)
- `aiohttp` module (`pip install aiohttp`)
- `aiofiles` module (`pip install aiofiles`)
- `plyer` module (`pip install plyer`)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install dependencies using pip.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command installs all necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

### Downloading Files

Download one or more files from specified URLs.

```bash
python async_downloader.py url1 url2 url3 -f filename1 filename2 filename3
```

- `url1`, `url2`, `url3`: URLs of files to download.
- `-f filename1 filename2 filename3`: Optional custom filenames for downloaded files. If not provided, filenames will be inferred from URLs.

## Examples

### Example 1: Downloading Files

```bash
python async_downloader.py https://example.com/file1.zip https://example.com/image.jpg -f archive.zip picture.jpg
```

Downloads `file1.zip` from `https://example.com/file1.zip` and `image.jpg` from `https://example.com/image.jpg`, saving them as `archive.zip` and `picture.jpg`, respectively.

## Notifications

Upon successful download of each file, a desktop notification will be displayed (using Plyer) with details of the downloaded file.

Make sure to replace placeholders like `your-username`, `your-repository`, `async_downloader.py`, and adjust example URLs and filenames according to your specific implementation. This README.md now includes clear instructions on how to clone the repository, install dependencies, and use the script effectively.
